In the version you are about to play, you are the main character of "Metal Slug", a blonde chiselled jaw soldier that has been deployed on an unknown territory to defeat 5 enemies using a powerful weapon, which fires bullets that on contact with enemies will make them vanish away...and their belongings.

The weapon than the soldier is using includes an revolutionary high tech silencer and as a well trained soldier, our main character wont make any noises even when he is reached by an enemey gun. So will the enemy soldiers do.

The game is displayed as a minigame.

If you lose, you have to reload the page to play again.

Please don´t get upset if you lose, it is just a game.


## Your mission:

Attention corporal! Some enemy soldiers have been spotted nearby. We need you
to go out there and defeat them. Once the mission is accomplished, you will be able to return
back home in the truck. Remember, the truck wont set off until you defeat all of them.
Good luck!

## Quick instructions:

1. Use A and D to move left and right respectively.
2. Use the spacebar to jump.
3. Click on the map to fire against your enemies.

Your mission and instructions will be displayed beside the game so dont worry about forgetting about them.

# Developer feedback

My main Goal was to recreate the original game as it was and more or less i achieved that, saving the distances of course. The game had loads of interactions, movements and sprites that only a few of them were displayed on Hacker Slug.

Things that im proud of:

Some of the features that thrilled me the most when I created them and they worked are things that a normal user wouldn´t notice but here you have some of them:

1. The soldiers stay still if you reach any of the 2 limits of the map.
2. Bullets dont get slowed down when you move forwards and backwards.
3. Bullets desapear when they reach the end of the map.
4. The player can shoot forward and backwards using a ternary.
5. Indentation.

Things that could have been improved:

1. Try again button.
2. Some Audio.
3. Better sprites.
4. More functionalities and additional stages.
5. A better lay out for the instructions and mission.

Things that got on my nerves, just a little bit:

1. Some of the forEach to create bullets.
2. Positioning of the images inside the canvas when you win or lose
3. The idiea of creating the bullets and enemybullets inside the classes of the player and soldier.

Huge thanks to my Teachers Carol Alonso, Pablo Laso and Teacher Assistants Manu Carrillo, Marcos Monzón and Carlos de la Torre.
